What is a Joint Event?
A joint event is an event that is defined by the intersection of two or more simple events. We use the notation:

P(A ∩ B) = Probability that both A and B occur

Read as "Probability of A and B"

Key Concepts
1. The Multiplication Rule
For any two events A and B:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

Where:

P(B|A) = Probability of B given that A has occurred (conditional probability)

2. Special Case: Independent Events
Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

For independent events:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

Examples with Coins, Dice, and Cards
Coin Examples
Example 1: Two independent coin flips

Event A: First flip is Heads

Event B: Second flip is Tails

P(A ∩ B) = P(Heads) × P(Tails) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

Example 2: Three specific outcomes

What's P(Heads on 1st AND Heads on 2nd AND Tails on 3rd)?

P = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8

Dice Examples
Example 3: Rolling two dice

Event A: Die 1 shows 4

Event B: Die 2 shows 2

P(A ∩ B) = (1/6) × (1/6) = 1/36

Example 4: Dependent dice scenario

Roll one die twice

Event A: First roll > 4 (outcomes: 5, 6)

Event B: Second roll < First roll

This is dependent because Event B depends on what happened in Event A

We need conditional probability: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

Card Examples
Example 5: Drawing two cards without replacement

Event A: First card is a Heart

Event B: Second card is a Heart

P(A) = 13/52 = 1/4

P(B|A) = 12/51 (one Heart already removed)

P(A ∩ B) = (13/52) × (12/51) = 156/2652 ≈ 0.0588

Example 6: Specific card combination

Event A: Card is a King

Event B: Card is a Spade

P(A ∩ B) = P(King of Spades) = 1/52

Important Distinctions
Independent vs. Dependent Events
Independent:

Coin flips

Dice rolls

With replacement scenarios

Dependent:

Drawing cards without replacement

Real-world scenarios where one event affects another

Joint Probability vs. Other Probabilities
P(A ∩ B): Both A and B occur

P(A ∪ B): Either A or B or both occur

P(A|B): A occurs given that B has occurred

Special Formulas
For Mutually Exclusive Events (cannot happen together):
P(A ∩ B) = 0

For Independent Events:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

General Multiplication Rule:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = P(B) × P(A|B)

Practice Problems
What's the probability of rolling a 3 on a die AND flipping Heads on a coin?

P = (1/6) × (1/2) = 1/12

Draw two cards from a deck (without replacement). What's P(First is Ace AND Second is King)?

P = (4/52) × (4/51) = 16/2652 ≈ 0.00603

Flip a coin 4 times. What's P(All four are Tails)?

P = (1/2)^4 = 1/16
