    "# Independence\n",
    "Independence is a crucial concept where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Definition\n",
    "Two events A and B are independent if and only if:\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "This also implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = P(B)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Independent Events\n",
    "1. No Influence\n",
    "The outcome of one event has no impact on the other\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that B occurred gives no information about whether A occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conditional Probability Equals Marginal Probability\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Symmetry\n",
    "If A is independent of B, then B is independent of A\n",

    "\n",
    "P(Heads on 3rd) = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "These are independent: P(H1 ∩ H2 ∩ H3) = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8\n",

    "Example 2: Different coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Flip two different coins\n",
