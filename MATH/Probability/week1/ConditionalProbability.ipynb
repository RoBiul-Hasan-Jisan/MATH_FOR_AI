    "# Conditional probability\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It's a fundamental concept for understanding dependent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Definition\n",
    "The conditional probability of A given B is:\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), provided P(B) > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = \"Probability of A given B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = Probability that both A and B occur\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = Probability of event B\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Interpretation\n",
    "P(A|B) answers the question: \"If I know that B has happened, what is the probability that A also happens?\"\n",
