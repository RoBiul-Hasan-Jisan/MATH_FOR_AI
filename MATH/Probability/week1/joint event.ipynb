    "# Joint Event\n",
    "A joint event is an event that is defined by the intersection of two or more simple events. We use the notation:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = Probability that both A and B occur\n",
    "\n",
    "Read as \"Probability of A and B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "1. The Multiplication Rule\n",
    "For any two events A and B:\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = Probability of B given that A has occurred (conditional probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Special Case: Independent Events\n",
    "Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For independent events:\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples with Coins, Dice, and Cards\n",
    "Coin Examples\n",
    "Example 1: Two independent coin flips\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A: First flip is Heads\n",
    "\n",
    "Event B: Second flip is Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = P(Heads) × P(Tails) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Three specific outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "What's P(Heads on 1st AND Heads on 2nd AND Tails on 3rd)?\n",
    "\n",
    "P = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8\n",

    "Dice Examples\n",
    "Example 3: Rolling two dice\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A: Die 1 shows 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Event B: Die 2 shows 2\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = (1/6) × (1/6) = 1/36\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4: Dependent dice scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Roll one die twice\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A: First roll > 4 (outcomes: 5, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Event B: Second roll < First roll\n",
    "\n",
    "This is dependent because Event B depends on what happened in Event A\n",
    "\n",
    "We need conditional probability: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Card Examples\n",
    "Example 5: Drawing two cards without replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A: First card is a Heart\n",
    "\n",
    "Event B: Second card is a Heart\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = 13/52 = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = 12/51 (one Heart already removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A ∩ B) = (13/52) × (12/51) = 156/2652 ≈ 0.0588\n",

    "Example 6: Specific card combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Event A: Card is a King\n",
    "\n",
    "Event B: Card is a Spade\n",
