A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment. It provides a quantitative description of random phenomena.

Formal Definition
A random variable X is a function:
X: S → ℝ
where S is the sample space and ℝ is the set of real numbers.

Types of Random Variables
1. Discrete Random Variables
Takes on countable values (finite or infinite)

Examples: Number of heads, dice rolls, number of students

2. Continuous Random Variables
Takes on uncountable values in an interval

Examples: Height, weight, time, temperature

Discrete Random Variables
Probability Mass Function (PMF)
For a discrete random variable X, the PMF is:
p(x) = P(X = x)

Properties:

0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all x

∑ p(x) = 1 (sum over all possible x)

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∑ p(t) for t ≤ x

Examples of Discrete Random Variables
Example 1: Coin Flips
Let X = number of heads in 3 coin flips

Sample Space: {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

PMF:

P(X = 0) = P(TTT) = 1/8

P(X = 1) = P(HTT, THT, TTH) = 3/8

P(X = 2) = P(HHT, HTH, THH) = 3/8

P(X = 3) = P(HHH) = 1/8

CDF:

F(0) = P(X ≤ 0) = 1/8

F(1) = P(X ≤ 1) = 1/8 + 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2

F(2) = P(X ≤ 2) = 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 = 7/8

F(3) = P(X ≤ 3) = 1

Example 2: Dice Sum
Let X = sum of two dice

PMF (partial):

P(X = 2) = 1/36

P(X = 3) = 2/36

P(X = 4) = 3/36

...

P(X = 7) = 6/36

...

P(X = 12) = 1/36

Continuous Random Variables
Probability Density Function (PDF)
For a continuous random variable X, the PDF f(x) satisfies:

f(x) ≥ 0 for all x

∫ f(x) dx = 1 (over all real numbers)

Important: P(X = x) = 0 for any specific x
We calculate probabilities over intervals:
P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ f(x) dx from a to b

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫ f(t) dt from -∞ to x

Relationship: f(x) = dF(x)/dx

Examples of Continuous Random Variables
Example 3: Uniform Distribution
X ~ Uniform(a, b)
PDF: f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b, 0 otherwise

Example: Bus arrives every 10 minutes uniformly

P(wait ≤ 3 minutes) = 3/10 = 0.3

P(4 ≤ wait ≤ 7) = (7-4)/10 = 0.3

Example 4: Exponential Distribution
Models time between events
PDF: f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0

Example: Customer arrivals with rate λ = 2 per hour

P(time between arrivals > 0.5 hours) = e^(-2×0.5) = e^(-1) ≈ 0.368

Expected Value (Mean)
Discrete Case:
E[X] = μ = ∑ x × p(x)

Continuous Case:
E[X] = μ = ∫ x × f(x) dx

Examples:
Die Roll: E[X] = 1×(1/6) + 2×(1/6) + ... + 6×(1/6) = 3.5

Coin Flips (3 flips):
E[X] = 0×(1/8) + 1×(3/8) + 2×(3/8) + 3×(1/8) = 1.5

Variance
Measures spread or dispersion around the mean

Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²] = E[X²] - (E[X])²

Discrete Case:
Var(X) = ∑ (x - μ)² × p(x)

Continuous Case:
Var(X) = ∫ (x - μ)² × f(x) dx

Examples:
Die Roll:

E[X] = 3.5

E[X²] = 1²×(1/6) + 2²×(1/6) + ... + 6²×(1/6) = 91/6 ≈ 15.167

Var(X) = 15.167 - (3.5)² = 15.167 - 12.25 = 2.917

Important Discrete Distributions
1. Bernoulli Distribution
Single trial with success probability p

X = 1 (success) with probability p, X = 0 (failure) with probability 1-p

E[X] = p, Var(X) = p(1-p)

2. Binomial Distribution
Number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials

PMF: P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

E[X] = np, Var(X) = np(1-p)

Example: Probability of exactly 7 heads in 10 coin flips

P(X = 7) = C(10,7) × (0.5)^7 × (0.5)^3 = 120 × (1/128) = 15/128 ≈ 0.117

3. Poisson Distribution
Number of events in fixed interval of time/space

PMF: P(X = k) = (λ^k × e^(-λ)) / k!

E[X] = λ, Var(X) = λ

Example: Calls arrive at rate 5 per hour

P(exactly 3 calls in next hour) = (5³ × e^(-5)) / 3! ≈ 0.140

Important Continuous Distributions
1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian)
PDF: f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) × e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))

Bell-shaped curve

2. Exponential Distribution
PDF: f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0

Memoryless property

3. Uniform Distribution
PDF: f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b

Transformations of Random Variables
If Y = g(X), then:

Discrete: P(Y = y) = ∑ P(X = x) for all x such that g(x) = y

Continuous: Use CDF method or transformation formulas

Example: If X ~ Uniform(0,1) and Y = 2X + 3

Then Y ~ Uniform(3, 5)

Practice Problems
Let X = number of 6's in 4 dice rolls. Find PMF and E[X].

Binomial with n=4, p=1/6

E[X] = 4 × (1/6) = 2/3

The time (in hours) until a light bulb burns out follows exponential distribution with mean 1000 hours. Find probability it lasts more than 1500 hours.

λ = 1/1000

P(X > 1500) = e^(-1500/1000) = e^(-1.5) ≈ 0.223

Let Z ~ N(0,1). Find P(-1 ≤ Z ≤ 1).
