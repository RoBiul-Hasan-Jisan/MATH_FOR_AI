The binomial distribution is one of the most important discrete probability distributions, modeling the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.

Binomial Coefficient
The binomial coefficient counts the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order.

Notation and Formula
C(n,k) = n! / (k! × (n-k)!)
Also written as: $\binom{n}{k}$ or "n choose k"

Properties of Binomial Coefficients
Symmetry: C(n,k) = C(n, n-k)

Boundary values: C(n,0) = C(n,n) = 1

Recurrence relation: C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k)

Sum of all: ∑ C(n,k) = 2ⁿ

Examples:
C(5,2) = 5!/(2!×3!) = 120/(2×6) = 10

C(7,3) = 7!/(3!×4!) = 5040/(6×24) = 35

C(10,0) = 1

C(8,8) = 1

Binomial Distribution Definition
A random variable X follows a binomial distribution if:

Conditions (BINS):
Binary outcomes: Each trial has only two possible outcomes (success/failure)

Independent trials: The outcome of one trial doesn't affect others

Number of trials fixed: We conduct exactly n trials

Same success probability: Probability of success (p) remains constant for all trials

Probability Mass Function (PMF)
P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n

Where:

n = number of trials

k = number of successes

p = probability of success on each trial

1-p = probability of failure on each trial

Step-by-Step Examples
Example 1: Coin Flips
Problem: Fair coin flipped 5 times. Find probability of exactly 3 heads.

Solution:

n = 5, k = 3, p = 0.5

C(5,3) = 10

P(X = 3) = 10 × (0.5)³ × (0.5)²

= 10 × (1/8) × (1/4) = 10/32 = 5/16 = 0.3125

Example 2: Quality Control
Problem: 10% of items are defective. If we test 8 items, what's the probability exactly 2 are defective?

Solution:

n = 8, k = 2, p = 0.1

C(8,2) = 28

P(X = 2) = 28 × (0.1)² × (0.9)⁶

= 28 × 0.01 × 0.531441 = 0.1488

Example 3: Multiple Choice Test
Problem: 10 questions, each with 4 choices. Student guesses randomly. Find probability of getting exactly 6 correct.

Solution:

n = 10, k = 6, p = 1/4 = 0.25

C(10,6) = 210

P(X = 6) = 210 × (0.25)⁶ × (0.75)⁴

= 210 × 0.000244 × 0.316406 = 0.0162

Complete Distribution Example
Let's build the complete binomial distribution for n=4, p=0.3

k	C(4,k)	p^k	(1-p)^(4-k)	P(X = k)	Calculation
0	1	0.3⁰=1	0.7⁴=0.2401	0.2401	1×1×0.2401
1	4	0.3¹=0.3	0.7³=0.343	0.4116	4×0.3×0.343
2	6	0.3²=0.09	0.7²=0.49	0.2646	6×0.09×0.49
3	4	0.3³=0.027	0.7¹=0.7	0.0756	4×0.027×0.7
4	1	0.3⁴=0.0081	0.7⁰=1	0.0081	1×0.0081×1
Verification: 0.2401 + 0.4116 + 0.2646 + 0.0756 + 0.0081 = 1.0000 ✓

Mean and Variance
Expected Value (Mean)
E[X] = n × p

Variance
Var(X) = n × p × (1-p)

Standard Deviation
σ = √[n × p × (1-p)]

Examples:
Coin flips (n=10, p=0.5): E[X] = 5, Var(X) = 2.5, σ ≈ 1.58

Quality control (n=20, p=0.1): E[X] = 2, Var(X) = 1.8, σ ≈ 1.34

Cumulative Probabilities
We often need probabilities for ranges:

Common Ranges:
P(X ≤ k) = ∑ P(X = i) for i = 0 to k

P(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X ≤ k-1)

P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∑ P(X = i) for i = a to b

Example:
For n=5, p=0.4, find P(X ≥ 3)

P(X ≥ 3) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)

= C(5,3)(0.4)³(0.6)² + C(5,4)(0.4)⁴(0.6)¹ + C(5,5)(0.4)⁵(0.6)⁰

= 10×0.064×0.36 + 5×0.0256×0.6 + 1×0.01024×1

= 0.2304 + 0.0768 + 0.01024 = 0.31744

Each number is the sum of the two numbers above it.

Useful Formulas:
C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n,n) = 2ⁿ

C(n,1) = n

C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2

C(n,n-1) = n

Practice Problems
A family has 6 children. If probability of boy = 0.51, find probability of exactly 3 boys.

n=6, k=3, p=0.51

C(6,3) = 20

P(X=3) = 20 × (0.51)³ × (0.49)³ = 0.3125

Basketball player makes 80% of free throws. If she takes 5 shots, find:

a) P(all 5 made) = (0.8)⁵ = 0.3277

b) P(at least 4 made) = P(4) + P(5)

P(4) = C(5,4)(0.8)⁴(0.2)¹ = 5×0.4096×0.2 = 0.4096

P(5) = 0.3277

Total = 0.7373

Multiple choice: 20 questions, 4 choices each. Passing = 12+ correct. If guessing, find P(pass).

This would require summing P(12) through P(20)

Very small probability!

Special Cases
When p = 0.5
The binomial distribution is symmetric:

P(X = k) = P(X = n-k)

Example: For coin flips, P(3 heads) = P(3 tails)

When n is large
The binomial distribution approximates the normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem)
