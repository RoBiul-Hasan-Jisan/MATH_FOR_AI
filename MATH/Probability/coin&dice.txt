Part 1: The Coin (A Simple Two-Outcome System)
A fair coin is the simplest probability model. We assume it's "fair" (no bias) and that each flip is independent (previous flips don't affect future ones).

Sample Space (All Possible Outcomes): {Heads, Tails} or {H, T}

Total Number of Outcomes: 2

Probability of a Single Event:

P(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%

P(Tails) = 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%

Key Examples:

Probability of getting exactly one Head in one flip?

That's just P(H) = 1/2.

Probability of getting exactly two Heads in two flips?

Sample Space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}

Total Outcomes: 4

Successful Outcome: {HH}

Probability: 1/4

Probability of getting at least one Tail in two flips?

Sample Space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}

Successful Outcomes: {HT, TH, TT}

Probability: 3/4

Pro-Tip: This is 1 - P(No Tails) = 1 - P(HH) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

Part 2: The Dice (A Six-Outcome System)
A standard die is a cube with six faces. We assume it's "fair".

Sample Space (for one die): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Total Number of Outcomes (for one die): 6

Probability of any single number: P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(6) = 1/6

Key Examples (with one die):

Probability of rolling an even number?

Successful Outcomes: {2, 4, 6}

Probability: 3/6 = 1/2

Probability of rolling a number greater than 4?

Successful Outcomes: {5, 6}

Probability: 2/6 = 1/3

Key Examples (with two dice):

This is where it gets interesting. When rolling two dice, it's best to think of them as Die 1 and Die 2.

Total Number of Outcomes: 6 (for Die 1) × 6 (for Die 2) = 36

The best way to visualize this is with a table. The sums are in the cells.

Die 2: 1	Die 2: 2	Die 2: 3	Die 2: 4	Die 2: 5	Die 2: 6
Die 1: 1	2	3	4	5	6	7
Die 1: 2	3	4	5	6	7	8
Die 1: 3	4	5	6	7	8	9
Die 1: 4	5	6	7	8	9	10
Die 1: 5	6	7	8	9	10	11
Die 1: 6	7	8	9	10	11	12
Probability of rolling a sum of 7?

Count the 7s in the table: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) → 6 outcomes.

Total Outcomes: 36

Probability: 6/36 = 1/6 (This is the most likely sum!)

Probability of rolling a sum of 10?

Count the 10s: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) → 3 outcomes.

Probability: 3/36 = 1/12

Probability of rolling a sum of 2 (Snake Eyes)?

Only one outcome: (1,1)

Probability: 1/36 (This is the least likely sum, along with 12).

Probability of rolling doubles (same number on both dice)?

Successful Outcomes: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) → 6 outcomes.

Probability: 6/36 = 1/6

Part 3: A Deck of Cards (A More Complex System)
A standard deck has 52 cards.

Total Number of Outcomes: 52

The deck is broken down into four suits:

Hearts (Red) - 13 cards

Diamonds (Red) - 13 cards

Clubs (Black) - 13 cards

Spades (Black) - 13 cards

Each suit contains 13 ranks:

Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.

The Jack, Queen, and King are called Face Cards.

Key Examples:

Probability of drawing a Heart?

Number of Hearts: 13

Probability: 13/52 = 1/4

Probability of drawing a Face Card?

Number of Face Cards: 4 suits × 3 face cards/suit = 12

Probability: 12/52 = 3/13

Probability of drawing the Ace of Spades?

There is only one Ace of Spades.

Probability: 1/52

Probability of drawing a red King?

There are two red kings: King of Hearts and King of Diamonds.

Probability: 2/52 = 1/26

Summary: The Core Principle of Probability
For any event where all outcomes are equally likely, the fundamental formula is:

Probability of an Event = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes)
